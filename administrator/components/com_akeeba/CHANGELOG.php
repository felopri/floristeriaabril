Akeeba Backup 3.11.2
================================================================================
! Backup before update resulting in 403 error when updating Joomla!

Akeeba Backup 3.11.1
================================================================================
! CLI scripts were not being copied over
! [PRO] ALICE will suggest to use the Large Site Scanner, if required
+ The 'Backup on Update' plugin now allows you to select which backup profile to use for taking a full site backup before updating Joomla!
+ ANGIE now allows you to restore tables with zero-value auto_increment columns (used by Magento, Drupal, possibly others)
~ Replacing legacy mooTools code with jQuery
# [LOW] Disabling the System Restore Points with the "Back to standard installer" link wasn't always respected

Akeeba Backup 3.11.0
================================================================================
+ Show update information in the component's control panel page
+ Allow the user to forcibly reload the update information from the component's control panel page
+ Backup progress also shown on the browser tab's icon using Piecon
+ You can now change the date format of the Start column of the Manage Backups page
+ Database table installation, uninstallation and update is now handled by our own code instead of the unreliable JInstaller code
+ Work around against certain browsers (e.g. Safari) and password managers auto-filling fields marked with autocomplete="off"
+ Display a warning when you set up an ANGIE password during backup
+ [PRO] Added CLI script to check for new versions and automatically update Akeeba Backup
~ Working around Safari browser ignoring web standards: it always auto-completes a password field even when web developers explicitly specify autocomplete="off"
# [HIGH] Accessing the component fails on Joomla! 3.2.x if the core database has not been updated
# [MEDIUM] Blank page or 400 error message after updating from 3.10.1 or lower using Live Update
# [MEDIUM] WebDAV upload fails depending on whether you have a trailing slash in the base URL and a leading slash in the directory name
# [MEDIUM] ANGIE: Sometimes a fatal error is thrown on redirection
# [MEDIUM] The CLI check script was not working under Joomla 2.5
# [LOW] Some languages do not include a translation for the new PLG_SYSTEM_AKEEBAUPDATECHECK_MSG string
# [LOW] A tilde in the PHP version could cause a cosmetic error (a warning printed out) during restoration. Functionality was not affected by this issue.

Akeeba Backup 3.10.2
================================================================================
+ [PRO] Special ANGIE versions for WordPress, phpBB and miscellaneous PHP scripts allow you to backup and restore even more sites and scripts!
+ [PRO] CRON script to check for failed backups
~ Now using the built-in Joomla! extensions updater instead of Live Update to deliver updates
~ Live Update now uses the same Bootstrap style as the rest of the component
~ Live Update now uses database storage to solve issues with it getting stuck on some sites
~ Instruct browsers to NOT auto-complete password fields in the configuration page. Some browsers will STILL perform auto-completion.
~ Update backup duration after post-processing is finished, giving more accurate information about backups uploading their archives to remote storage
~ The size of the failed backup is stored when the backup record is being cleaned up automatically
- Removing the obsolete "Akeeba Backup Notification Module"

+ You can specify the large file threshold (it was previously hard-coded to 10Mb)
+ "Large site scanner" engine for sites with directories containing hundreds or even several thousands of files
+ [PRO] System Restore Points now support extension types: package, library, file
~ Ignoring filters and engines with non-alphanumeric characters in their names, preventing crashes on hosts which automatically create copies of files e.g. folders.php to filders.1.php without asking the user

# ANGIE doesn't reset the secret key in configuration.php
# [MEDIUM] Lite Mode was broken

~ Improved detection of administrator email addresses
~ Warn users of the Core release that entering the Download ID doesn't magically "unlock" the Professional features

# [MEDIUM] The Extension Manager: Update page displays wrong when the System Restore Points feature is enabled on Joomla! 2.5, using Firefox (other Joomla! versions / browsers are not affected)
# [MEDIUM] The alternate CRON backup script (akeeba-altbackup.php) would go on forever

# [LOW] [PRO] CLI CRON scripts not fully compatible with PHP CGI

Akeeba Backup 3.7.10
================================================================================

Akeeba Backup 3.3.7
================================================================================
+ Add delete support for CloudFiles so that remote quotas are possible with it
+ Add download support for CloudFiles so that you can fetch archives back to your server
+ Add delete support for DropBox so that remote quotas are possible with it
+ Add download support for DropBox so that you can fetch archives back to your server
+ If Admin Tools Professional is installed, the update notification email link will include your administrator secret word.
~ Updated bundled JavaScript libraries to jQuery 1.7 and jQuery UI 1.8.16
# ABI: Invalid use of DS
# System Restore Point backups would appear in the "latest backup" view
# Sending backup completion emails was impossible from the CLI scripts (backup.php, altbackup.php)
# If you did not specify an email address, Akeeba Backup would fail fetching the Super Administator email addressed under Joomla! 1.7
# "Transfer Archive" would appear for obsolete backup records (Pro release)
# Regression: could not upload archives from the Administer Backup Files page
# Non-standard administrator templates could have a problem with the backup status icon module hiding everything on the page

Akeeba Backup 3.3.6
================================================================================
~ #247 Propose a fix for non-existent/unwritable backup output directory
# Cosmetic: #253 CHANGELOG would display an page showing [object] Object on Firefox
# Cosmetic: Tooltips on exclusion views would float out of view
# Make sure that we have at least PHP 5.2.7 before enabling the administrator module and the system plugins
# Backing up Thumbs.db and .DS_Store files cause extraction to fail on Windows and Mac OS X respectively; as of now, we don't back them up
! Command-line backup would not run on Joomla! 1.7 due to missing DS constant, still required by Joomla!

Akeeba Backup 3.3.5
================================================================================
+ Showing backup record ID in Administer Backup Files page
+ The Akeeba Backup admin icon now inlines itself to the Joomla! control panel's Quick Icons module

# Regression: Count quotas would remove the latest, not the oldest, backup files
# Installing Akeeba Backup would remove the menu item link for Akeeba Subscriptions
# Akeeba Backup notification module: "Enable warnings" had no effect
# Use of AKEEBAPRO instead of AKEEBA_PRO in administrator/components/com_akeeba/views/backup/tmpl/default.php (fixed by doorknob)

# Would not show development version only updates

# Notice thrown by the native dump engine (cosmetic issue)

Akeeba Backup 3.3.4
================================================================================
+ Explanatory text regarding archive restoration in the Core release, when you visit the Administer Backup Files page
+ Improved message in the case of an error which will help you solve the issue yourself
+ ACL checks in the backup status administrator module
+ Row-level filtering is now possible (by creating a PHP filter file)
+ ABI is now self-documenting; no excuses for not reading the fine manual any more!
+ Added warning about UNC paths when used as the site's root, since PHP is very often buggy with respect to UNC paths
~ Modified the success message after taking a System Restore Point, backing up before upgrading Joomla! or otherwise take a backup as part of an automated process with a return URL
~ backup.php now returns exit code 1 if there were warnings or 2 if the backup failed on an error
~ Changed Akeeba Backup's installation page to better lead you to your next steps.
~ Renamed jquery.js to akeebajq.js due to some system plugins removing all instances of jquery.js from the page source (whichever idiot wrote them!)
~ Renamed jquery-ui.js to akeebajqui.js due to some system plugins removing all instances of jquery-ui.js from the page source (whichever idiot wrote them!)
~ Updated SRP definitions for Akeeba Backup, Admin Tools, Akeeba Subscriptions and Akeeba Release System
# tmp directory would not be cleaned up after extensions installation when SRP is used
# The Configuration page would not render on IE7, IE8 and IE9 (the latter only when using Compatibility mode)
# Backup age quotas caused the backup finalization to crash on PHP 5.2
# --quiet option added to backup.phpto suppress output except warnings and errors
# When using a developer's release, Live Update would always report that a newer version is available
# When a Windows server is using a UNC path for the site's root, the backup always failed
# When jQuery wasn't loaded, the message urged you to use Google AJAX API, which is no longer an option.
# ABI: Would always report that the storage isn't working when the session save path is unwritable but ABI could create a storage file to store session information.
# Quotas would delete the most recent files, not the oldest files

Akeeba Backup 3.3.3

# Restoration of a System Restore Point would not restore database content if it was very big (thanks to the guys at Migur for discovering it)
# During a System Restore Point restoration the database restoration progress would not be printed out
# Timezone was reset to UTC on Joomla! 1.6 and later when the server default timezone wasn't set, instead of letting Joomla! define the timezone based on Global Configuration preferences

# Improved installation and uninstallation under Joomla! 1.6/1.7, working around Joomla! bugs which would prevent installation

================================================================================
! The new quota implementation wasn't compatible with PHP 5.2 and threw a fatal error

# Live Update would not refresh the version status after applying an update
# The "back to Control Panel" button in Step 3 of the Site Transfer Wizard would do nothing at all
# Some buggy servers report file lengths as floats, misleading Akeeba Backup into believing that it is unable to backup correctly the site's files
# Inversion of logic on AEPlatform::get_site_root() would cause issues on servers which report "/" as the site's root
# The ACL view in Joomla! 1.5 wouldn't allow you to change the permissions for individual users

# The administrator backup notification icon module wasn't removed on component uninstall
# Large files in ZIP archives would always have a wrong uncompressed size of 4Gb
# Remote files quotas would not be applied
# Invalid ZIP central directory record generated meant the archive wouldn't be extracted by thirdparty unarchivers

# If no files were being backed up from a root directory, an empty directory entry would be created, potentially making extraction impossible
# The remote API wouldn't return progress information
