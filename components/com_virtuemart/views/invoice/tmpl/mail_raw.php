/**
*
* Layout for the shopper mail, when he confirmed an ordner
*
* The addresses are reachable with $this->BTaddress, take a look for an exampel at shopper_adresses.php
*
* With $this->cartData->paymentName or shipmentName, you get the name of the used paymentmethod/shippmentmethod
*
* In the array order you have details and items ($this->orderDetails['details']), the items gather the products, but that is done directly from the cart data
*
* $this->orderDetails['details'] contains the raw address data (use the formatted ones, like BTaddress). Interesting informatin here is,
* order_number ($this->orderDetails['details']['BT']->order_number), order_pass, coupon_code, order_status, order_status_name,
* user_currency_rate, created_on, customer_note, ip_address
