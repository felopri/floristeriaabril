; DATABASE_LBL_HOSTNAME_HELP="The host name or IP address of the database server (usually: localhost). Please note that localhost and 127.0.0.1 are <em>very</em> different as far as MySQL is concerned; you may have to try both to see which works with your database server. If your server is using a non-standard port, append it after the hostname prefixed with a colon, e.g. 127.0.0.1:1234 to use a database server on 127.0.0.1 listening to port 1234."
; DATABASE_LBL_USERNAME="User name"
; DATABASE_LBL_USERNAME_HELP="The username you use to connect to your database. Most hosts using cPanel, Plesk and other major hosting panels will give usernames like abcdef_username, where abcdef is your hosting control panel username. If unsure, please ask your host."

; DATABASE_LBL_FOREIGNKEY="Suppress foreign key checks"
; DATABASE_LBL_FOREIGNKEY_HELP="Disables MySQL's foreign key checking while the restoration is in progress. This is mandatory when you are restoring a database which uses table-level relations (foreign keys). If unsure, leave this checked; it won't do any harm."
; DATABASE_LBL_REPLACE="Use REPLACE instead of INSERT"
; DATABASE_LBL_REPLACE_HELP="ANGIE will normally use INSERT commands to restore the database data. This doesn't work well with certain extensions' data, causing restoration issues. If you get database restoration errors please check this box and click the Next button again."
; DATABASE_LBL_FORCEUTF8DB="Force UTF-8 collation on database"
; DATABASE_LBL_FORCEUTF8DB_HELP="When checked, ANGIE will try to convert the default collation of your table to Unicode (UTF-8), as suggested by Joomla!. This doesn't work on all servers. Check it if you get question marks or broken text instead of international characters."

; DATABASE_LBL_MAXEXECTIME="Maximum execution time"

; DATABASE_LBL_THROTTLEMSEC="Throttle time (msec)"
; DATABASE_LBL_THROTTLEMSEC_HELP="ANGIE can optionally throttle down the rate of the database restoration process for severely misbehaving servers. You can enter the throttle time between processing chunks in milliseconds (1/1000 of a second). For example, in order to add a 5 second throttle time between steps enter 5000 in this box.

; SETUP_LBL_LIVESITE="Live site URL"
; SETUP_LBL_LIVESITE_HELP="Some servers have trouble figuring out the URL of your site which can lead to SEF URLs and menu items not working. On these servers you have to enter your site's URL without the trailing slash, e.g. <tt>http://www.example.com</tt>. In most cases this is not required and you can leave this field empty."
; SETUP_LBL_USESITEDIRS="Override tmp and log paths"
; SETUP_LBL_USESITEDIRS_HELP="ANGIE will by default use the tmp and log paths already set up on the backed up site's Global Configuration. If you are restoring to a different server or cloning your site this can lead to problems. In this case, check the box. If you are unsure, check the box anyway. You can change these paths in the Directories Fine-tuning section below."
; SETUP_LBL_COOKIEDOMAIN="Cookie domain"
; SETUP_LBL_COOKIEDOMAIN_HELP="The Cookie domain is the domain name of your site, without the protocol and, usually, without the www part. For example, if you are restoring to http://www.example.com, the Cookie domain is example.com (Let us stress that again: there is NO http:// in there!!)."
; SETUP_LBL_COOKIEPATH="Cookie path"
; SETUP_LBL_COOKIEPATH_HELP="The Cookie path is the subdirectory of your site, relative to the domain's root. If you are restoring to the root of a domain, e.g. http://www.example.com, then it is / (a single forward slash). If you are restoring to a subdirectory it's a slash followed by the directory's name. For example, if you're restoring to http://www.example.com/joomla then the Cookie path is /joomla (WITH a leading slash, but WITHOUT a trailing slash)."

; SETUP_HEADER_FTPPARAMS="FTP Layer Options"
; SETUP_HEADER_FTPPARAMS_HELP="These are optional settings which allow Joomla! to use FTP to write to otherwise unwriteable files and directories. This is usually required only on shared hosts. See the help text of the options for more information."
; SETUP_LABEL_FTPENABLE="Enable the FTP layer"
; SETUP_LABEL_FTPENABLE_HELP="Some shared hosts make it impossible for PHP to write to files and directories uploaded by FTP. If you are on such a host and have used FTP or Kickstart's Upload by FTP extraction option you want to configure and enable the FTP layer."
; SETUP_LABEL_FTPHOST="Host name"
; SETUP_LABEL_FTPHOST_HELP="The host name or IP address of your FTP server <b>without</b> the ftp:// protocol specifier. It's usually localhost or 127.0.0.1. If unsure, ask your host."

; SETUP_LABEL_SUPERUSER_HELP="Select a Super User to modify. <b>Only the selected Super User will be modified!</b>"
; SETUP_LABEL_SUPERUSEREMAIL="E-mail"
; SETUP_LABEL_SUPERUSEREMAIL_HELP="Enter the e-mail address of the Super User. Make sure it's not used by another user on the site, otherwise your restored site will be broken!"

; SETUP_LABEL_SUPERUSERPASSWORDREPEAT_HELP="Repeat the password. This allows us to make sure you didn't do a typo above."

; SETUP_HEADER_FINETUNING="Directories fine-tuning"
; SETUP_HEADER_FINETUNING_HELP="Joomla! needs two writeable directories for its temporary files and logs. You can define them here. Tip: if they are unwriteable but you have already enabled the FTP layer above, ANGIE will attempt to make them writeable and secure them automatically."
; SETUP_LABEL_SITEROOT="Site root"
; SETUP_LABEL_SITEROOT_HELP="This is the path to your site's root. It is displayed for your convenience. Triple click (or long tap) on it to select it; then you can copy it and use it in the fields below."
