When the user clicks the download icon, the browser will prompt to save the image in this folder to the user's local computer instead of the (possibly lower-resolution) image that is being shown in the lightbox pop-up window. The full-size image folder is useful for providing a high-quality image version for archival or printing rather than web browsing. If no high-quality version is available, the same image as shown in the lightbox pop-up window will be downloaded. Use a relative path, which is interpreted w.r.t. the image folder."
SIGPLUS_BASE_URL="Base URL"
SIGPLUS_BASE_URL_DESCRIPTION="Base URL that corresponds to absolute image (base) folder. This field should be left empty if the image (base) folder is a relative path w.r.t. the Joomla root directory.

SIGPLUS_SORT_ORDER_DESCENDING="descending"
SIGPLUS_LINKAGE="Data population method"
SIGPLUS_LINKAGE_DESCRIPTION="Determines how gallery data is embedded in or linked to the webpage. When a gallery is embedded, HTML code is emitted directly in the page body; this is recommended for galleries of small to medium size. When a gallery is generated from script, only a placeholder is emitted in the page body, and JavaScript code is used to populate the placeholder with gallery items. The JavaScript code can be placed either in the HTML head or in an external file; the latter is strongly recommended for large galleries (100 or more images). The downside to script-based population as opposed to embedding the gallery directly in the page body is that search engines are unable to index galleries created in this manner."
SIGPLUS_LINKAGE_INLINE="embed in HTML body"
SIGPLUS_LINKAGE_HEAD="generate using script in HTML head"
SIGPLUS_LINKAGE_EXTERNAL="generate using external script in cache folder"
SIGPLUS_AJAXAPI="AJAX library source"
SIGPLUS_AJAXAPI_DESCRIPTION="Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to fetch script libraries (e.g. jQuery) when the site is exposed to the public internet, in which case the pages of your site may load significantly faster. On the other hand, you might want to set AJAX library source to a <em>local copy</em> if your site is accessible only within a (corporate) intranet; or <em>none</em> if you use a separate system plug-in to load script libraries. This setting (with a value other than <em>none</em>) only affects performance, not functionality."

The tag name may only contain (English) letters and is case-sensitive."
SIGPLUS_DEBUG="Debug mode"
SIGPLUS_DEBUG_DESCRIPTION="Whether to use uncompressed versions of lightbox, slider and captions engine scripts. Normally, compressed and obfuscated versions of these scripts are used to conserve network bandwidth usage. Debug mode is useful if you experience a script error on a page and you would like to discover its cause, which is difficult to perform with obfuscated names. When asking for support, please make sure to enable debug mode."
SIGPLUS_CUSTOM="Custom settings"
SIGPLUS_CUSTOM_DESCRIPTION="Parameters as <kbd>name=value</kbd> pairs to pass unaltered to sigplus. Each parameter should occupy a single line. For the plug-in, this is equivalent to specifying these parameters in every single occurrence of the activation tag; for the module, it allows customization that would not otherwise be available via controls in the back-end. For example, when using the boxplus lightbox window, passing the <kbd>lightbox:contextmenu=0</kbd> parameter disables the context menu when right-clicking an image in the pop-up window. For the complete list of parameters, consult the sigplus documentation."
SIGPLUS_SETTINGS="Backup/Restore settings"
